# mlAutoVirt
This simulator first presents a virtual 3D enviroment, containing a terrain with low slopes, a road and a car.
When you are running the simulation, you are positioned as the driver of the car.
You drive the car using the arrow keys:
UP = Foward acceleration.
DOW = reduce speed until stop.
LEFT and RIGHT turns the car to the respective direction.

TODO:

- Press R to record the driving.
- Press Q to stop a recording session.
- The images of the session will be used, along with the corresponding actions (key pressing) for each image, on a neural network to learn how to drive the car.
- Using the result of the learning proccess, you finally press A to let the virtual car drive itself along the road.
